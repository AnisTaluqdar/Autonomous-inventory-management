# Autonomous-inventory-management
This project applies computer vision to automate shelf tracking in retail. Smart cameras scan shelves, identifying stock gaps and price errors. It enables swift restocking, improving efficiency and customer experience. Inspired by Schnuck Markets' Tally robot, which improved out-of-stock detection, this initiative advances retail automation.
